# Data Structure Simulation Visualizer

An interactive **web-based visualization tool** to help understand and simulate fundamental **data structures** through animations and step-by-step operations.<br>
This project is designed mainly for **students and beginners** to visualize how data structures work internally rather than just learning them theoretically.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Interactive visualization of core data structures
- Step-by-step simulation of operations
- Simple and intuitive UI
- Web-based (no installation required)
- Beginner-friendly and educational

### Supported Visualizations
- Stack
- Queue (Linear Queue)
- Linked List (SLL)
- Binary Tree  
*(More can be added easily)*

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **PHP** – Page structure and routing
- **CSS** – Styling and layout
- **JavaScript** – Logic, animations, and interactions

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project

To visually demonstrate how data structures operate <br>
To help learners understand internal working mechanisms <br>

Useful for: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;College students <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exam preparation <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teaching & demos <br>

## 📌 Future Enhancements (Planned)
Add more data structures (Graph, Heap, Hash Table) <br> 
Deploy as a GitHub Pages / hosted demo <br>
